### Random Password Generator

This activity was designed to teach the ability to create javascript code to generate a random password
with 8 to 128 characters

### Progress

This program is not able to produce a password with 8 to 128 characters. Through one cycle it is able to distinguish what kinds of 
values to produce however. The if functions in the writePassword function are able to remove the designate values from the charset
variable that will determine the values used in the password. I could have definitely spent more time on this activity however I got caught up in the break and did not expect to have as much trouble as I did. However I was able to learn a great deal about javascript from this 
activity. I believe if I could pull the value from the prompt that asks for the number of characters and multiple that by the loop, then I might have something that functions at least as a basic password generate. I would like work on this some more to see if I can get it to work or even see where I went wrong and what I am missing. 

I will definitely need to do more research on attributes and javascript functions.
